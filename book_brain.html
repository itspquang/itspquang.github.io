    <h1>The Brain That Changes Itself: Stories of Personal Triumph from the Frontiers of Brain Science</h1>
    <p>The book is a collection of stories of doctors and patients showing that the human brain is capable of undergoing change, 
        including stories of recovering use of paralyzed body parts, deaf people learning to hear, and others getting relief from pain
         using exercises to retrain neural pathways. Doidge also covers scientists who first identified neuroplasticity, the subjects of 
         persistent pain, sexual attraction and love, how culture impacts the changing brain, the developing pediatric brain and the 
         preservation of the geriatric brain.</p>
    <p>Dr. Doidge, a Canadian psychiatrist and award-winning science writer, recounts the accomplishments of the "neuroplasticians," as he calls the neuroscientists involved in these new studies, with breathless reverence. Their work is indeed mind-bending, miracle-making, reality-busting stuff, with implications, as Dr. Doidge notes, not only for individual patients with neurologic disease but for all human beings, not to mention human culture, human learning and human history.

        <br>— New York Times
    </p>
    <p>The book is rich in both journalism and science. Not only does the author have professional credentials deriving from his 
        training as a psychiatrist and analyst, but he also has extensive experience in writing, including a three-year stint writing 
        the column 'On Human Nature' for the Canadian newspaper The National Post. [...] More than anything else, it is Doidge's 
        standing as a professioinal observer of human behavior that ultimately captivates the reader.

        <br>— Peter Reiner in American Journal of Bioethics</p>
